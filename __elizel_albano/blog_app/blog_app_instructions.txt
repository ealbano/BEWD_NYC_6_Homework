-X create model Post and Comment
-X Post should have title and content
-X A Comment should have content, email and the post reference
-X A post can have many comments
-X create restful resource of Post (index, show, create, etc.)
-X root url should be the posts index
-X allow for commenting on posts show page (a form, list of comments)

If this is too easy, setup authentication system using devise.
